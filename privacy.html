        <h2>1. Information We Collect and Why</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Email address:</b> Used for authentication and to identify your account.</li>
            <li><b>OAuth tokens (gmail.readonly, gmail.modify):</b> We request the narrowest possible permissions. 
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-top:0.5rem;"><code>gmail.readonly</code> is used to read the content of the email you are currently viewing to provide analysis.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top:0.5rem;"><code>gmail.modify</code> is used solely to insert generated draft replies into your Gmail when you click the "generate reply" button.</li>
                </ul>
            We do not have permission to, and do not, send emails on your behalf or access your emails outside of the currently active message.
            </li>
            <li><b>Browser type & IP address:</b> Stored in temporary server logs for security and debugging purposes.</li>

        <h2>2. Data Handling and Retention</h2>
        <p><b>We do not permanently store your email content.</b> Email content is processed transiently in memory and is never saved to our servers' disks.</p>
        <p>Any metadata or analysis results derived from email processing (such as an intent summary) are <b>automatically and permanently deleted from our systems within 7 days</b> of creation. This is to provide you with a short window to review past activity if needed for support reasons, while minimizing data retention.</p>
