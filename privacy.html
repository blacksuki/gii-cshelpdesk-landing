        <h2>1. Information We Collect and Why</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Email address:</b> Used for authentication and to identify your account.</li>
            <li><b>OAuth Scopes for Gmail Add-on:</b> We request the narrowest possible permissions to function within Gmail. 
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-top:0.5rem;"><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.readonly</code> is used to read the content of the email you are currently viewing to provide analysis. We cannot access any other messages.</li>
                    <li style="margin-top:0.5rem;"><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose</code> is used solely to create a draft reply for the current message when you click an action button.</li>
                </ul>
            We do not have permission to, and do not, send emails on your behalf or access any emails outside of the single message you have open in the add-on.
            </li>
            <li><b>Browser type & IP address:</b> Stored in temporary server logs for security and debugging purposes.</li>
            <li><b>Cookies:</b> Essential session cookies to keep you logged in and preference flags.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Handling and Retention</h2>
        <p><b>We do not permanently store your email content.</b> Email content is processed transiently in memory and is never saved to our servers' disks.</p>
        <p>Any metadata or analysis results derived from email processing (such as an intent summary) are <b>automatically and permanently deleted from our systems within 7 days</b> of creation. This is to provide you with a short window to review past activity if needed for support reasons, while minimizing data retention.</p>

        <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Google User Data</h2>
        <p>To provide our core features, we share a limited subset of your Google user data with third-party AI service providers (such as Google Cloud AI or OpenAI). Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited_use_requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What is shared:</b> The text content (body and subject) of the currently active email is sent to our AI provider for analysis and draft generation.</li>
            <li><b>What is NOT shared:</b> We do not share your name, email address, or OAuth tokens with our AI providers. The data is sent for processing and is not used to train their models or stored long-term on their systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>We do not sell, transfer for marketing purposes, or otherwise disclose your Google user data to any other third parties</b>, except as explicitly listed in the "Third-Party Processors" section below for the essential functioning of the service.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Processors</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to provide our application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Paddle.com:</b> Used for payment processing and tax compliance. Paddle receives your email address, invoice amount, currency, and IP address (for fraud detection).
                <br>Paddle’s privacy policy: <a href="https://paddle.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://paddle.com/privacy</a>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-top:0.5rem;">
                <b>AI Service Providers (e.g., Google Cloud AI, OpenAI):</b> Used to analyze email content and generate reply drafts. These providers process email text transiently and are contractually obligated not to store it or use it for training their models.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
        <p>Essential cookies keep you signed in. You can block cookies in your browser, but the service will not be able to function.</p>
